## üìã Summary

Implement a comprehensive User datastore with enhanced profile management, financial tracking, address management, and privacy-compliant location services for the AI-driven Spending Transaction Monitor system.

## üéØ Business Value

**As a** spending transaction monitor system  
**I want** a robust user datastore with comprehensive profile management  
**So that** I can track user financial behavior, provide location-based alerts, and maintain detailed customer profiles for personalized spending insights.

## üìù Description

Design and implement a User model that serves as the foundation for the spending transaction monitor system. The datastore must support advanced features including financial tracking, address management, location-based services with privacy compliance, and integration with transaction and alert systems.

### **Core Requirements:**

1. **User Profile Management**: Complete user identity and contact information
2. **Address Management**: Full address tracking for location-based features  
3. **Financial Data**: Credit limits and current balance tracking
4. **Location Services**: Privacy-compliant mobile app and transaction location tracking
5. **System Integration**: Relationships with credit cards, transactions, and alerts

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### **AC1: Basic User Profile**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema**
```sql
model User {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  email             String   @unique
  firstName         String
  lastName          String
  phoneNumber       String?
  
  // Address information
  addressStreet     String?
  addressCity       String?
  addressState      String?
  addressZipCode    String?
  addressCountry    String?  @default("US")
  
  // Financial information
  creditLimit       Decimal? @db.Decimal(12, 2)
  currentBalance    Decimal? @db.Decimal(12, 2) @default(0.00)
  
  // Location tracking (with privacy consent)
  locationConsentGiven      Boolean @default(false)
  lastAppLocationLatitude   Float?
  lastAppLocationLongitude  Float?
  lastAppLocationTimestamp  DateTime?
  lastAppLocationAccuracy   Float?
  
  // Last transaction location
  lastTransactionLatitude   Float?
  lastTransactionLongitude  Float?
  lastTransactionTimestamp  DateTime?
  lastTransactionCity       String?
  lastTransactionState      String?
  lastTransactionCountry    String?
  
  // Timestamps
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime @updatedAt
  isActive          Boolean  @default(true)
  
  // Relationships
  creditCards       CreditCard[]
  transactions      Transaction[]
  alertRules        AlertRule[]
  alertNotifications AlertNotification[]
}
```

### **Required Indexes**
- `users_email_key` (unique index on email)
- `users_addressCity_addressState_idx` (composite index for location queries)
- `users_locationConsentGiven_idx` (index for privacy compliance)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- [ ] User creation with required fields
- [ ] Email uniqueness validation
- [ ] Default value assignments (country, balance, consent)
- [ ] Optional field handling (null values)
- [ ] Timestamp automatic updates

### **Integration Tests**
- [ ] User creation with complete profile
- [ ] Address update operations
- [ ] Financial data updates
- [ ] Location consent and data management
- [ ] Relationship cascade operations

### **Data Tests**
- [ ] Seed script creates valid user data
- [ ] Update script modifies existing users
- [ ] Verification script displays complete user profile
- [ ] Privacy compliance: location data requires consent

### **Performance Tests**
- [ ] Email lookup performance (< 1ms)
- [ ] Location-based queries (city/state index)
- [ ] Bulk user operations
- [ ] Relationship join performance

## üìä Sample Data

```typescript
{
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  phoneNumber: '+1-555-0123',
  
  // Address
  addressStreet: '123 Main Street, Apt 4B',
  addressCity: 'San Francisco',
  addressState: 'CA',
  addressZipCode: '94102',
  addressCountry: 'US',
  
  // Financial
  creditLimit: 15000.00,
  currentBalance: 2347.85,
  
  // Location (with consent)
  locationConsentGiven: true,
  lastAppLocationLatitude: 37.7749,
  lastAppLocationLongitude: -122.4194,
  lastAppLocationTimestamp: '2024-01-17T18:30:00Z',
  lastAppLocationAccuracy: 5.0,
  
  // Last transaction location
  lastTransactionLatitude: 37.7849,
  lastTransactionLongitude: -122.4094,
  lastTransactionTimestamp: '2024-01-17T19:20:00Z',
  lastTransactionCity: 'San Francisco',
